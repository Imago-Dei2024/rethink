                        Does insurance cover ketamine therapy or Spravato?

                        <p><strong>Ketamine Therapy:</strong> Traditional ketamine infusion therapy is generally not covered by insurance as it is considered an off-label use of the medication. Patients typically pay out-of-pocket for these treatments. We offer package pricing and payment plans to help make ketamine therapy more accessible.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>Spravato (Esketamine):</strong> Spravato is FDA-approved for treatment-resistant depression and is covered by many insurance plans. Coverage typically requires prior authorization and documentation that you have tried and failed to respond to at least two antidepressant medications. Our staff will work with your insurance company to determine coverage and obtain necessary authorizations.</p>
                        
                        <p>We're committed to helping you understand your coverage options and will provide transparent pricing information before you begin treatment.</p>

                        <p>Ketamine works differently than traditional antidepressants. While most antidepressants primarily affect serotonin, norepinephrine, or dopamine systems, ketamine acts on the glutamate system—the most abundant neurotransmitter in the brain.</p>
                        
                        <p>Specifically, ketamine blocks NMDA receptors and activates AMPA receptors, which leads to increased levels of glutamate. This triggers a cascade of events that ultimately:</p>
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li>Promotes the growth of new neural connections (synaptogenesis)</li>
                            <li>Increases brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which supports neuron health</li>
                            <li>Reduces inflammation in the brain</li>
                            <li>Disrupts established patterns of negative thinking</li>

                            <li><strong>Infusion:</strong> The ketamine will be administered slowly through the IV over about 40-60 minutes. The dose is carefully calculated based on your weight and adjusted according to your response.</li>
